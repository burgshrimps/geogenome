# Machine Learning in Bioinformatics: GeoGenome

This is the repository for an articile on Medium. The main idea is to build a machine learning model which can predict the superpopulation of an individual based on their genomic variation.

## Hint
The calculation of the Hamming distances between all samples is quite computationally intensive. In case you don't want to redo the whole analysis you can skip that part and use the "samples_subset.tsv" and "ham_dist.txt" files.
